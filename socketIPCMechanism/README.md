Interprocess Communication & Socket Programming Assignment

Assignment Overview
-------------------
This assignment focuses on implementing various Interprocess Communication (IPC)
mechanisms in C and developing a socket-based ATM simulation system. The goal is to
strengthen your understanding of IPC techniques, multithreading, file handling, and client–
server communication.
---------------------------------------------------------
Part 1: Interprocess Communication (IPC) Programs
---------------------------------------------------------
You must implement the following IPC mechanisms in C. Each must be a separate program
with clear input/output behavior and comments.
There will be two processes. The first process will read the integer array data and display it
before sorting, the second process will sort the data, and then the first process will display
the data after sorting.
1. File-Based IPC Mechanism
2. Message Queue IPC Mechanism
3. Pipe IPC Mechanism
4. Shared Memory IPC Mechanism
---------------------------------------------------------
Part 2: Socket-Based ATM Transaction Simulation
---------------------------------------------------------
You must implement a TCP client-server system using socket IPC.
Supported Operations:
1. Withdraw Amount
2. Deposit Amount
3. Display Current Balance
---------------------------------------------------------
Server Requirements
---------------------------------------------------------
- Use TCP sockets.
- Maintain a shared data file (e.g., account.txt) to store current balance and user data.
- For every client request:
 - Create a dedicated thread using pthreads.
 - Process the specific transaction (withdraw, deposit, display).
 - Update/read the shared balance safely.
- Implement synchronization using mutex to protect file access.
- Return the result back to the client.
---------------------------------------------------------
Client Requirements
---------------------------------------------------------
- Connect to the server using TCP socket.
- Display menu:
 1. Withdraw
 2. Deposit
 3. Display Balance
 4. Exit
- Send request to server.
- Receive transaction result and print it.
---------------------------------------------------------
Transaction Logic
---------------------------------------------------------
- Withdrawal should fail if amount > available balance.
- Deposit adds the amount to the balance.
- All balance updates must be written to the file.
- Server must handle concurrent clients request using threads.
